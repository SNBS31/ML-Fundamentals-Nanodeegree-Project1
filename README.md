# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction with AutoGluon

## Project Overview

In this project, I utilized the AutoGluon library to train several models for the **Bike Sharing Demand** competition on Kaggle. The objective was to leverage Tabular Prediction to fit data from CSV files provided by the competition. This project not only demonstrates my ability to use AutoGluon effectively but also showcases my skills in optimizing predictive models.

Bike-sharing demand is a critical aspect for companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash. By predicting demand accurately, businesses can prepare for service spikes and enhance customer experiences by minimizing delays.

## Project Approach

The project followed a three-step approach:

1. **Default Model**: 
   - I started with a baseline model to assess the raw dataset's performance. This initial step guided me through the uncharted territories of data exploration.

2. **Model with Additional Features**: 
   - Armed with insights from extensive data analysis, I crafted new features to enhance the predictive model. These nuanced features proved pivotal in capturing intricate data patterns, significantly boosting the model's accuracy.

3. **Model with Hyperparameter Tuning**: 
   - Refining the model's hyperparameters was an iterative process akin to fine-tuning a masterpiece. Through meticulous optimization, I sculpted the model to achieve its peak performance, ensuring exceptional accuracy.

## Results

After applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and necessary feature engineering, my dedication yielded a score of **0.44645790695**, which translates to a **44% improvement** over the baseline model. This result showcases AutoGluon's prowess in accelerating machine learning workflows.

## Conclusion

This project not only enhanced my understanding of predictive modeling but also equipped me with valuable insights that I am eager to leverage in future projects. I look forward to continuing to push the boundaries of innovation in the field of machine learning! ðŸš€
